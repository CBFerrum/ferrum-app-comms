# Changelog

## 0.1.0

- First release as a standalone Ferrum app (previously part of the Ferrum repository).
- Passwords, the inbound webhook token, calendar feed tokens and the newsletter signing key are platform secret fields (sealed, write-only); the package's own secrets table is gone.
- Mail and chat attachments use the platform's file storage (`/api/files`), attached to the record a mail belongs to; the package's own attachment table and upload endpoint are gone.
- The inbound raw-MIME webhook accepts messages up to 32 MB.
- Comms Users read and edit their own communications through the generic API as well.
